To practice building a voice synthesis test modal, it involves building sawtooth waveform through partials in form of sinus oscillators, applying five format filters of resonance two-pole filters to synthesize logarithmic frequency in MIDI, specifying sound level and spectral slope of the source, and finally the most interesting part, testing the built modal with my own voice source to compare with the original recorded source files.
